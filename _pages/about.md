I have always had an interest in video/audio editing and various creative projects that usually involve learning some kind of new skill. 
Iâ€™ve spent a lot of time studying different editing techniques and have learned a lot about many different kinds of software, like Adobe Premiere Pro and Final Cut. 
In my spare time I enjoy watching YouTube, playing video games with friends and learning new things. 
I enjoy most content created by a channel called EposVox which is an educational channel on various audio and video filming techniques. 
I also enjoy watching Linus Tech Tips, which is a channel more focused on enterprise IT equipment.
