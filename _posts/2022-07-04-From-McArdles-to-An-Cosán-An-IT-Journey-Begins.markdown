**Today marks the day I embark on a new journey, transitioning from my role as an IT Helpdesk Technician at McArdles Computer and Office Supplies in Monaghan to becoming an IT Support Officer at An Cosán in Tallaght, Dublin. This shift is not only a career change, but it's also a significant personal milestone.**

I started my journey in the midst of the 2020 pandemic when I joined McArdles. We all remember the sudden shift to remote work; many see it as a quick step that happened overnight. However, IT professionals worldwide had to make significant adjustments to ensure this transition was as seamless as possible.

> Change is the only constant in life - and in IT.

When I first joined McArdles, my role involved tackling odd jobs such as laptop repairs. As I got into the swing of things, I noticed Microsoft beginning to promote SharePoint and Teams. 
Seeing the potential benefits for our clients, I took it upon myself to learn more about these tools. 
By the end of my tenure, I had become one of the go-to resources for knowledge about these systems.

Towards the end of my time at McArdles, we started seeing an influx of charities eager to avail of Microsoft's Office 365 donations. 
This opportunity allowed me to fully onboard these companies, from purchasing and configuring domains and DNS records to setting up Office 365 and tailoring SharePoint and Teams to meet their needs.

I want to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to the team at McArdles. They welcomed me, someone fresh out of secondary school and yet to receive his Leaving Cert results, with open arms. 
Their faith in me has greatly contributed to my growth in the industry.

Today, on July 4th, 2022, I am excited to start a new chapter in my career at An Cosán, a non-profit organisation dedicated to empowerment through education.

An Cosán provides people of all ages with pathways to learning, leadership, and enterprise, offering courses from basic level to BA degree programmes. 
Their holistic approach includes Early Years' education, financial support, IT support, parenting support, and 1:1 mentoring, tutoring, and counselling. 
By offering some courses online and supporting a network of 220+ Community Partners, An Cosán's ethos is extended across Ireland.

My transition to An Cosán means shifting from a helpdesk managing multiple companies to being the dedicated IT Support Officer for a single organisation. 
I'm looking forward to the challenge, and I'm particularly excited about engaging with long-term projects such as a CRM/LMS from start to finish.

The opportunity to support An Cosán in its mission to empower more than 20,000 people and its ambition to reach another 20,000 by the year 2030, is truly inspiring.

As I stand on the brink of this new adventure, I look forward to what lies ahead. To the years of learning, growth, and success in this ever-evolving field.
