**Today marks my one-year anniversary as an IT Support Officer at An Cosán, a transition that has been nothing short of inspiring. As I reflect on the journey, I am struck by the power of community, education, and transformation that An Cosán embodies.**

The past year has been a whirlwind of events, projects, and moments that have deepened my understanding of community empowerment.
A significant part of my role was providing IT support for various events - Winter Ball 2022, International Community Seminar, Further and Higher Education Awards Ceremonies, and the moving Photovoice exhibition.
Liaising with AV companies and event organizers, I ensured we had all the technological requirements met to make each event a success. Each occasion was a unique opportunity to witness the transformative power of education and the strength of our community firsthand.

Managing the Laptop Loan Scheme for our learners has been another key component of my role.
It's given me a firsthand look at the importance of digital inclusion and the role it plays in removing barriers to education.
Being able to support our learners in this way and help bridge the digital divide has been incredibly rewarding.

The opportunity to teach the Community Employment (CE) members on the IT Support Team has been a highlight of my year.
Learning to navigate their schedules, assess their current skills, and identify areas for improvement has been a fulfilling challenge.
It's been a joy to help them grow in their IT knowledge and contribute to our collective mission.

Understanding and navigating the new funding landscape has also been a fascinating experience.
Having the opportunity to work with community funders has broadened my understanding of non-profit operations.
Liaising with suppliers and our external IT company to ensure the equipment we purchase is suitable for our learners' long-term use is a responsibility I relish.

As I embark on my second year with An Cosán, I carry with me the lessons and memories of the past year.
I look forward to continued growth, more empowerment, and countless opportunities to make a difference.
Here's to another year at An Cosán!
