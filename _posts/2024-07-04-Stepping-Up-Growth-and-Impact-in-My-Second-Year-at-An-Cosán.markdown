**Two years at An Cosán have passed, and while my title remains the same, my role has evolved significantly.**

This year has been one of transition and growth, not just for myself but for my team. My manager, formerly the Educational Technologist, has stepped into a new position as Higher Education Lead. With this change, I’ve taken on more responsibilities, reporting directly to Senior Management. While not a formal promotion, this shift has allowed me to step up, take greater ownership of key projects, and play a more strategic role in IT support across the organisation.

A major achievement this year has been our ability to manage AV and event technology in-house. Since acquiring our own AV equipment, we’ve reduced costs by handling smaller events, such as staff days and graduations internally. Training our Community Employment (CE) team members in AV setup has empowered them with new skills. A few hiccups here and there but that's all a part of the learning process!

Beyond events, my work has expanded into large-scale infrastructure projects. The Broadband and Phone System upgrade was a significant undertaking, affecting all six of our sites. Upgrading to a unified phone system has improved internal communications, streamlining operations across the organisation.

Another milestone was the Windows 11 upgrade. Ensuring that all staff devices transitioned smoothly required careful planning. Coordinating drop-in schedules, providing temporary laptops, and offering training during the transition were essential to maintaining workflow continuity. IT upgrades are necessary, but they should never disrupt the work that keeps the organisation running. By working collaboratively, rather than imposing rigid timelines, we ensured a smooth experience for everyone involved.

Taking a proactive approach, I’ve also initiated self-driven projects that go beyond day-to-day IT support. Conducting audits of our accounts, devices, and mobile phones has helped identify cost-saving opportunities. These audits are not just about numbers, they involve meeting with staff, understanding their needs, and ensuring that resources are allocated effectively.

This past year has reinforced an important lesson: IT is not just about technology; it’s about people. Every upgrade, every audit, every support request is ultimately about enabling our team to do their best work.
